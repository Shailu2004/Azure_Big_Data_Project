![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47abf7e7-4b7a-4fb5-b824-06e1bb294220)

This project demonstrates a comprehensive Azure Data Engineering workflow using multiple Azure resources to process and analyze an e-commerce dataset. The dataset consists of 8 files containing details about customers, payments, orders, and other key information. Below is an in-depth description of the project architecture, process, and technologies used.

Dataset Overview üìä
The dataset used in this project is an e-commerce dataset, containing:
  - Customer details
  - Payment transactions
  - Order information
  - Other supporting data
  -This dataset is stored in multiple sources, including SQL, MongoDB, and HTTP (GitHub). It offers a realistic and complex scenario for data engineering.

Azure Resources Utilized üí°
  - Azure Data Factory (ADF): For data ingestion and pipeline orchestration.
  - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2): For storing raw, cleaned, and transformed data in Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
  - Azure Databricks: For data transformation, cleaning, and integration of datasets.
  - Azure Synapse Analytics: For querying, creating views, and further analysis.
  - Files.io Web: A source for SQL and MongoDB data.
  - HTTP Data Source (GitHub): Additional data source to simulate diverse data inputs.

Project Workflow üîÑ

1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
  - The first step involves extracting raw data from various sources:
  - Files.io Web:
  - SQL database containing structured data.
  - MongoDB database containing semi-structured data.
  - Data manually uploaded for use as a source.
  - HTTP (GitHub):
  - Used as an additional source of data for variety.
  - Process in Azure Data Factory (ADF):
  - Created dynamic pipelines to extract data using Lookup, ForEach, and Copy Activities.
  - Data from SQL and HTTP sources was ingested and stored in the Bronze Layer of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) in its raw form.

2. Data Transformation (Silver Layer)
  - Data transformation and cleaning were carried out in Azure Databricks. This included:
  - Configurations for ADLS Gen2 Access: Set up configurations to read raw data from the Bronze Layer.
  - MongoDB Integration: Read data from MongoDB to introduce complexity and simulate real-world data engineering.
  - Data Transformation Steps:

Cleaning:
  - Removed duplicate rows and columns.
  - Standardized formats across datasets.

Merging:
  - Joined multiple tables using specific keys.

Combined SQL and MongoDB datasets.
Output:
  - A final, cleaned, and enriched dataset was generated.
Stored the processed data in the Silver Layer of ADLS Gen2 in Parquet format.

3. Data Analysis (Gold Layer)

  - The cleaned and transformed data from the Silver Layer was loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis.
  - Process in Synapse Analytics:
  - Loaded data into Synapse for SQL-based querying.
  - Created views to summarize and analyze the dataset.
  - These views provided insights and were stored in the Gold Layer of ADLS Gen2 for downstream consumption.

4. Visualization (Optional)
  - While the visualization was not the primary focus, initial efforts were made to use tools like Power BI to visualize the data. Future improvements could include:
Detailed dashboards.
Integration with Tableau or Power BI for real-time reporting.
